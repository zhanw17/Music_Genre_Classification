# Music Genre Classification

## Introduciton of the Project
Music has been known to humans for times immemorial. Ever since the melody of instruments has fallen on the ears of humans, it has implanted the seeds of emotions that are otherwise hard to achieve.
While music is altogether a melody that connects all hearts in this world, there are further classifications of music that bind together music lovers and keep the melody going on.
From K-Pop to Jazz, music lovers rely on the technology of music genre classification and are able to listen to songs as per their preferences. While it takes only a click for a listener to switch from Jazz music to Rap, there is certainly much more beneath the surface that fuels our love for music.
